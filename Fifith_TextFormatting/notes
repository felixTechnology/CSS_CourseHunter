1.change paragraph text -by default it is 16px, so when you use 16px you wont see the change unless higher value.
2. font-size: 25px, is an absolute measurement unit pixels .
 - There are relative measurement unit like, rem, %,

3. text-align:
- It allows us to change position of text, it has four main values (left,right,center,justify)
-by default the property of, text-align, is set as left. So if you assing it (text-align:left;) nothing will be changed
- In case of right text will be placed on right side (text-align:right;)
-In case of right text will be placed on right side (text-align:centre;)
-In case of justify text will be placed at end-to-end of page without leaving margin(space) at both right & left edge of the page (text-align: justify;)
-In case of justify-all text will be placed at end-left of page without leaving margin(space) but will leave a default margin at the right  (text-align: justify-all;)

NOTE:

-By default Paragraph <p></p> is example of block-level element , and text-align property works with block level elements

Block-level element takeup full width that is available on the page

In-line element, they take up width that is required to display content of an element;

-In other to transform Paragraph to (in-line element), we have property called (display: in-line)
- Note that, text-align, property doesnt work on, in-line element (EX: text-align: right) wont work on in-line element
  but to manipulate the position of paragraph by using it parent paragraph (<div></div>)



EXAMPLE:

p{
            background-color: #78a178;
            color: white;
            font-size: 25px;
            text-align:right;

  }

The term inheritance describes relationship between parent and child element
-In CSS each child inherit styles from it parent element
- In the example below the elements h1 and p will take the color of parent element body.
- the div take now take precedence over the body tag because that is the immediate parent of the child elements
- The h1 will take it own color because he is specific to its element

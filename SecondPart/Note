PRECEDENTS OF SELECTORS
---------------------------
Execution of CSS code happens line by line from top to buttom .

- You will notice the (ul>li) has different property values, the new one will over write the previous one
- You will notice (li) which is a child element has yellow color, but tat wont take effect. The (ul>li) green will over-write the
   two because (ul>li> is specific and based on precedence .

<style>
        h1, h2{
            color: green;
        }

         ul li{
             color: red;
         }

          ul li{
            color: green;
          }

          li{
             color: yellow;
          }
 </style>


 <body>
     <h1>Heading 1</h1>
     <h2>Heading 2</h2>


     <ul>
         <li>HTML 5</li>
         <li>CCS 3</li>
     </ul>
 </body>

1. Selecting element using class attribute has the higher precedence than selecting them using element names.
2. ID element works with multiple elements simultaneously but in a real-world it is recommended to use ID attribute with one element and Class attributes with several elements
3. ID attributes has the highest precedence than any other selector
4.Styling using Class attributes has higher precedence than styling using elements names
5.Styling element with parent element has higher precedence than styling with element name
6.ID selector has highest precedence than all of them (element name and class selector)

Note: that the below example the ID has highest precedence than the class selector so in styling the ID selector will over write that of class.
EXAMPLE: <ul>
           <li id='list-item' class='item'>HTML</li>
           <li id='list-item' class='item'></li>
       </ul>



EXAMPLE 2:
----------
1. If we want to use same styles for both input elements we can either ,assign to them same class ,and select them and style
2.  Or we can use input tag name
3. If we want to  style for one of the input then we can use ID or CLASS attributes and style
4.Or we use TYPE ATTRIBUTES , input[type="email"] {background-color: orange},

    <input type="text">

    <input type="email">
